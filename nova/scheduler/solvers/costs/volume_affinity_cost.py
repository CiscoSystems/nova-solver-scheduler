"""Volume affinity cost.
   This pluggable cost provides a way to schedule a VM on a host that has
   a specified volume.  In the cost matrix used for the linear programming
   optimization problem, the entries for the host that contains the
   specified volume is given as 0, and 1 for other hosts. So all the other
   hosts have equal cost and are considered equal. Currently this solution
   allows you to provide only one volume_id as a hint, so this solution
   works best for scheduling a single VM. Another limitation is that the
   user needs to have an admin context to obtain the host information from
   the cinderclient. Without the knowledge of the host containing the volume
   all hosts will have the same cost of 1.
